# Crime-Data-EDA

**Course Intro**: A 400-level advanced data visualization class which are cross-listed as open to both undergraduates and graduate students, itâ€™s challenging for an undergraduate student and requires much effort. 

**Final project**: An exploratory data analysis and visualization project which contains three parts of deliverables - coding, presentation and written report. We are free to choose any interested topic and need to find raw dataset then start the project from scratch. 

**Dataset**: [Homicides Report 1980 - 2014](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/murderaccountability/homicide-reports) 

I found Homicides Report 1980 - 2014 Dataset on kaggle and did an exploratory data analysis & visualization research on this dataset. I focused on exploring possible meaningful combinations between two or multiple factors and perform an exhaustive exploratory data analysis on finding their hidden relationships, converted the numerical information into graphical representation for the purpose of achieving more efficient comparison and tested the possibility of elevating the work to the next stage by applying basic machine learning classification methods. 

**Tools**: Python, Matplotlib, seaborn, plotly.  \
**Techniques**: 1D plot(time series line chart, bar graph, histogram, box plot), 2D plot(heatmap, seaborn bar plot, jointplot with KDE, stacked bar graph), multidimensional(radar chart) and map. I also picked up two special cases which are juvenile criminals & serial killers and tried to use visualization methods to solve the patterns within them. 

**Deliverables**: [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/yiyutao22/Crime-Data-EDA/blob/main/I422%20Data%20Visualization/Final%20Project/Deliverables/Yiyu_Tao_I422%20Project.ipynb)
